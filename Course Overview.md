## Description
This class explores the sounds of non-built environment from historical, cultural, musical, and ecological perspectives. Environmental sounds have a unique place in history—they have served as music, as sound effects, and more recently as markers of ecological health. In addition to classroom lectures and discussion, we’ll do some “field work” outside, including regular soundwalks.
