<h3 id="finalproject">Final Project</h3>

<p><strong>Annotated Bibliography and Proposal Due April 10<br/>
In-Class Presentations on April 29 and May 1<br/>
Final Project Due on May 6</strong></p>

<p>Your second formal writing assignment is actually the first step in your final project for this class. For this project, you will undertake serious scholarly research on a topic of your choice related to sound and auditory culture. Like in our previous assignments, this can be almost anything from any time period or location—with one catch: you will have to interview at least one person who either has firsthand knowledge of your topic or is an &#8220;expert&#8221; on it. Your interviewee does not have to have advanced degrees, but he or she should be able to tell you something interesting about your topic. You will need to incorporate this voice into your paper and final project, in addition to the other stated requirements. As we mentioned in class, a previously-recorded interview is acceptable.</p>

<h3 id="annotatedbibliographyandproposal">Annotated Bibliography and Proposal</h3>

<p>The first step in your final project will be an annotated bibliography and research proposal. The annotated bibliography should sketch out, as best you can, an overview of the topic that you will be approaching. In order to accomplish this, you should not just include your &#8220;best&#8221; or &#8220;favorite&#8221; sources, but also the ones with which you disagree—either in subject matter, methodology, or both. If there are two sides (or more) to this topic, show them both. If there are different ways to approach it (acoustics, history, philosophy, film), then try to represent those as well (as long as they are relevant to your project). You should have <strong>at least</strong> four sources, with the annotation taking up about one page (double-spaced). You should start with a paragraph or so introduction to the sources and the topic.</p>

<p>Once you are through with your annotations, you should then take 1&#8211;2 pages to outline your own project. As I have mentioned earlier, this can take a variety of forms. You can do another audio essay, you can write a longer, argumentative research paper, some combination, or something else entirely—it&#8217;s really up to you. But I do need to sign off on it, so please make a compelling case for your idea!</p>

<p>So, in summary: this is a 5&#8211;7 page paper, with four annotated sources and your final project proposal.</p>

<h3 id="finalproject">Final Project</h3>

<p>Because you will determine the format of your final project in consultation with me, so will the specific expectations and standards for how you will be evaluated. Whatever shape your project takes, it will be due in my office or via electronic delivery by the end of our exam period, which is 8:40pm on May 6th. As that date gets closer, please let me know when you plan on turning it in, so I&#8217;m not sitting in my office all night! As always, good luck and have fun with it!</p>
