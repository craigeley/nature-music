      	<h3>Policies</h3>

<h4>Attendance</h4>

<p>In a small seminar such as this one, attendance is critical to the success of the class. Everyone gets two absences—these are the "no-questions-asked-don't-even-bother-to-email-me" kind of absences. You are responsible for the work that you miss on those days, so I would suggest making a class friend. Though you might think that emailing me to ask what you missed is being "responsible," it's usually not—I already taught class once that day, and I'm not always in the mood to do it again. Obviously, certain individual circumstances will require individual attention.</p>

<p>After your two free absences, I'm going to start deducting 6 percentage points from your participation grade per absence. (So, with 4 total absences, your highest possible participation grade could be a 88%).</p>

<h4>Statement of Academic Integrity</h4>

<p>Penn State defines academic integrity as the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. All students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. Dishonesty of any kind will not be tolerated in this course. Dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work of other students. Students who are found to be dishonest will receive academic sanctions and will be reported to the University’s Judicial Affairs office for possible further disciplinary sanction.</p>

<h4>Statement of Nondiscrimination</h4>

<p>The Pennsylvania State University is committed to the policy that all persons shall have equal access to programs, facilities, admission, and employment without regard to personal characteristics not related to ability, performance, or qualifications as determined by University policy or by state of federal authorities. The Pennsylvania State University does not discriminate against any person because of age, ancestry, color, disability or handicap, national origin, race, religious creed, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.</p>

<h4>Disability Access Statement</h4>

<p>If you have a documented disability and wish to receive academic accommodations, please contact the campus disability liaison as soon as possible. For additional information, check the university web site: http://www.equity.psu.edu/ods/</p>
